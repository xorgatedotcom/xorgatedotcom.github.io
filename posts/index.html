<p>An Internet decides that he knows better than some open source community how to
manage that community&rsquo;s trademarks. This, in his mind, gives him the right to
file for those trademarks around the world. The community, as well as HN,
politely tell him to fuck off. HN then breaks into a fight over whether mailing
lists are better than forums in any way other than keeping new users out.</p>

<p>A Twitter blinks an SOS message about Amazon participating too much in an open
source project. HN is ready to swing into action for defending <em>helpless open
source community</em> from <em>evil mega corporation</em>, but is unable to rally behind
what amounts to nothing more than a loud public sigh.</p>

<p>HN congratulates each other on having always known that Facebook, Twitter, the
elite, the government, and any group of people not living paycheck to paycheck,
are corrupt and morally rotten. HN also assures one another they would never
work for a corporations as evil as Facebook. Self-reflection is apparently left
as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>HN is shocked to learn that unfettered capitalism has seriously harmful
consequences to efficient markets and overall wellbeing of humanity. Gasp!
Some even wonder whether future historians might identify externalities that
are not priced into our current profits. Suggestions range from plastics over
sugar to Twitter. HN does not make the list for some reason.</p>

<p>HN rehashes the same old arguments for why cloud service providers don&rsquo;t turn
off your machines when you run out of money and instead just keep charging. The
rest of the comments are on topic: Discussing ways to (make random companies)
host Minecraft servers for people you don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>HN rehashes the same old arguments about why people don&rsquo;t turn off javascript
when browsing the web. The rest of the comments are on topic: Discussing ways to
make random companies host data they don&rsquo;t want to host. A few still believe the
Internet functions at all without Javascript in 2021.</p>

<p>Coinbase (business model: Uber for electricity bills) insists that keeping other
people&rsquo;s money in return for regular payouts is not a security. Neither the SEC
nor HN are impressed. The rest of the discussion is people arguing over how much
permission they need from which agency to invest their own money.</p>

<p>A company receives money to build another GPT-3. The model will likely be so
large and complex that the creators and a few megacorps will be capable of
running it. HN only discusses the overuse of the word &ldquo;democratize&rdquo;, eventually
degrading into dictionary wars.</p>
